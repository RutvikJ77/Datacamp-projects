If Dr. Semmelweis looks troubled it's probably because he's thinking about <em>childbed fever</em>: A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth. He is thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it. He is thinking about it because he knows the cause of childbed fever: It's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and <em>wash their hands</em>!</p>\n<p>In this notebook, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of <em>handwashing</em>. Let's start by looking at the data that made Semmelweis realize that something was wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital.</p>"},{"metadata":{"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true,"dc":{"key":"13f090f9f0"}},"cell_type":"code","outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"    year  births  deaths    clinic\n0   1841    3036     237  clinic 1\n1   1842    3287     518  clinic 1\n2   1843    3060     274  clinic 1\n3   1844    3157     260  clinic 1\n4   1845    3492     241  clinic 1\n5   1846    4010     459  clinic 1\n6   1841    2442      86  clinic 2\n7   1842    2659     202  clinic 2\n8   1843    2739     164  clinic 2\n9   1844    2956      68  clinic 2\n10  1845    3241      66  clinic 2\n11  1846    3754     105  clinic 2\n","name":"stdout"}],"execution_count":2,"source":"# importing modules\n# ...

The fate of Dr. Semmelweis\n<p>So handwashing reduced the proportion of deaths by between 6.7 and 10 percentage points, according to a 95% confidence interval. All in all, it would seem that Semmelweis had solid evidence that handwashing was a simple but highly effective procedure that could save many lives.</p>\n<p>The tragedy is that, despite the evidence, Semmelweis' theory — that childbed fever was caused by some \"substance\" (what we today know as <em>bacteria</em>) from autopsy room corpses — was ridiculed by contemporary scientists. The medical community largely rejected his discovery and in 1849 he was forced to leave the Vienna General Hospital for good.</p>\n<p>One reason for this was that statistics and statistical arguments were uncommon in medical science in the 1800s. Semmelweis only published his data as long tables of raw data, but he didn't show any graphs nor confidence intervals. If he would have had access to the analysis we've just put together he might have been more successful in getting the Viennese doctors to wash their hands.</p>"},{"metadata":{"tags":["sample_code"],"collapsed":true,"trusted":false,"dc":{"key":"0645423069"}},"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"execution_count":0,"source":"# The data Semmelweis collected points to that:\ndoctors_should_wash_their_hands = False"}],"nbformat_minor":2,"nbformat":4}
